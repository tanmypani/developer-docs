*Symptom*: If a user attempts to log in to the embedded ThoughtSpot app with an invalid token, the application locks that user's account. +

*Condition*: This issue is observed in ThoughtSpot deployments with the trusted authentication setup. +

*Workaround*: If you are using the trusted authentication method to authenticate your users, make sure the `getAuthToken` function in the SDK returns a fresh token for each re-login. Avoid using older tokens to renew a user session.
