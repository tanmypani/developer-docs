:page-description: This article lists features deprecated and no longer supported in ThoughtSpot Everywhere

As ThoughtSpot products evolve, sometimes existing features are deprecated and replaced with new and improved functionality. +
A deprecated feature may continue to be functional for a while, but may not be maintained or supported with the new workflows and functionality. Deprecated features will eventually be removed from the product and not supported in later releases.
////
De-supported::
A de-supported feature no longer exists in the product. When you upgrade to a newer release, any workflows that rely on a de-supported feature no longer work.

== Deprecation of REST v2 API

Starting from the ThoughtSpot 8.10.0.cl, ThoughtSpot will deprecate the REST v2 API [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints. +
The REST v2 API [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints will remain functional, but will be removed from the Playground page in the *Develop* tab when the REST v2.0 API endpoints are rolled out.

[NOTE]
====
If your current deployment is using REST v2 API [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints, your implementation will continue to work. However, ThoughtSpot recommends that you start using the REST v2.0 API endpoints as and when they are made Generally Available (GA).
====

=== REST v2.0 API rollout

To ensure a smooth transition for early adopters of the REST v2 API [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ feature, ThoughtSpot will roll out the REST v2.0 API feature in the following manner:

* The new REST v2.0 API endpoints will be introduced incrementally over the subsequent releases and replace all API operations supported by the current REST v2 API [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ version. ThoughtSpot encourages you to transition to the REST v2.0 API endpoints as and when they are GA.
* With the introduction of the new REST v2.0 API endpoints, the current REST v2 API [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints will be deprecated. The current REST Playground v2 in the *Develop* tab will be replaced with the new REST v2.0 API Playground.

=== REST API SDK
The current REST API SDK version will be deprecated from 8.8.0.cl onwards.
The upcoming REST v2.0 API endpoints and Playground will not support the SDK in the initial release. In later releases, a new version of the SDK will be published on the Playground, GitHub repo, NPM, PyPi, MVN Package Manager, and Nuget Package Manager sites.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using the REST API SDK, the existing version continues to work with REST v2 API [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints. ThoughtSpot does not recommend using REST v2.0 API endpoints with the SDK in its current state.
====

=== Documentation changes
The API documentation for the REST v2 API [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ will continue to be available until the REST v2 endpoints are functional. However, all references to the REST API SDK will be removed in the upcoming versions of Developer Documentation.

The API documentation for the new REST v2.0 API endpoints will be made available when the new endpoints are released for customer use.
