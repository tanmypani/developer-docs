:page-description: Embedded Analytics with ThoughtSpot

ThoughtSpot Everywhere provides a low-code embedded analytics platform for developers and product owners to build interactive data apps and incorporate ThoughtSpot functions and services directly into their apps, products, or services. Using ThoughtSpot Everywhere, you can embed search-driven analytics, infuse insights into your application, and enrich your website, portal, or product with ThoughtSpot's capabilities.

ThoughtSpot Everywhere offers a robust API framework with Visual Embed SDK and REST APIs to embed and customize ThoughtSpot components and automate deployments. You can explore these APIs and preview the coding experience in the interactive developer playgrounds.

== Visual Embed SDK
The Visual Embed SDK provides Javascript-based embed packages and client libraries to embed and customize ThoughtSpot components in your web application. The SDK package includes separate libraries for embedding Search, Liveboard, full ThoughtSpot application, or a single visualization. To explore the Visual Embed APIs, navigate to the *Develop* tab and click *Visual Embed Playground*.

For more information, see xref:visual-embed-sdk.adoc[Visual Embed SDK].

== REST API
ThoughtSpot REST API v1 framework allows your client applications to query data, add and modify ThoughtSpot objects, and perform administrative tasks.

The REST API v2[beta betaBackground]^Beta^ introduces new endpoints, improved request and response workflows, and an interactive Playground experience.

For more information, see xref:about-rest-apis.adoc[REST APIs].

== Developer portal

ThoughtSpot Everywhere users with Developer or admin privilege can access the *Develop* tab in the ThoughtSpot UI. The *Visual Embed Playground* allows you to explore the embedding options available with the SDK and view results instantly.

The *Develop* tab also provides separate playgrounds for REST API v1 and REST API v2, and several customization features.

For more information, see xref:spotdev-portal.adoc[ThoughtSpot Developer portal].

== Customization controls
UI customization and rebranding::
If you want to customize the look and feel of ThoughtSpot UI to match your organizationâ€™s branding guidelines, you can use the style customization settings in the Develop tab.

For more information, see xref:customize-style.adoc[Customize styles and layout].

Custom actions::
If you want to add a custom action to an embedded visualization or saved answer, use the xref:custom-actions.adoc[Custom actions] menu.

Custom link format::
To customize the host URL and resource path in the system-generated links, use the *Link settings* menu. For example, when your application user shares an embedded Liveboard with another user or group, ThoughtSpot can generate a link with your host application URL and the resource path specified in *Link settings*.

For more information, see xref:customize-links.adoc[Customize links].

Security settings::
If you are embedding ThoughtSpot in your application, you must add the domain URL of your application as a CSP and CORS host. These settings are available on the *Security settings* page. This page also allows you to enable trusted authentication and add redirect domains for SAML SSO authentication.
