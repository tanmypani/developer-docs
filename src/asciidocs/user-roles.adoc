:page-description: Configure users and groups with developer privileges

You will require a user account with `Developer` privilege to perform the following tasks in ThoughtSpot:

* Access the *Develop* tab in ThoughtSpot application.
* Customize and rebrand the look and feel of ThoughtSpot UI.
* Add custom actions to a Liveboard or visualization.
* Customize the format of links used in system-generated emails and notifications. 
* Configure visual embed hosts for CORS and CSP.
 
ThoughtSpot administrators can create a user group with `Developer` privilege enabled and assign users to this group. Administrators can configure developer access either using the *Admin* tab in the UI or the Group REST APIs. 

The following sections describe how to configure developer access using the *Admin* tab in the UI.
