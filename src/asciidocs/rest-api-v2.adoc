:page-description: ThoughtSpot REST API v2 provides service endpoints for user management, group administration, and metadata object queries.

The REST API v2 framework [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ is built upon the existing core API functionality and resource representation model, and offers several new features and enhancements.

Enhanced usability and developer experience::

With REST API v2, ThoughtSpot offers a user-friendly, interactive Playground to explore the endpoints, try out API requests and view responses. The Playground provides detailed information about how to get started, authenticate to ThoughtSpot, and interact with the endpoints.
+
For more information, see xref:rest-api-v2-playground.adoc[REST Playground v2].
////
The Playground provides dynamic code samples as you switch between different languages. You can also generate code samples, and download the SDK and client libraries in different programming languages.
////

////
Language-specific SDK and client libraries::

ThoughtSpot provides Java, Python, and TypeScript SDK and client libraries. If you want to call REST APIs in a language-specific way, you can download the SDK and libraries and integrate them with your environment.
+
For more information, see xref:rest-api-sdk-libraries.adoc[REST API SDK and client libraries].
////

Token-based authentication and authorization::

To provide secure access to ThoughtSpot resources, REST API v2 supports the OAuth 2.0 Bearer token and trusted authentication methods. You must obtain an access token before making an API call and pass the token in the `Authorization` header in the subsequent API calls.

+
For more information, see xref:authentication.adoc[REST v2 authentication].

Consistent request and response workflow::

With REST API v2, the API request and response format is standardized. The endpoints return data in the same format for all queries.

+
The REST API v2 supports the standard Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations and allow applications to use the standard HTTP verbs in API requests.

* **GET** to query information, such as getting a list of users, objects, or metadata headers
* **POST** to create or add new objects
* **PUT** to update object properties
* **DELETE** to remove objects and their associations
+

Simplified resource collections and endpoint categories::
+
The resource endpoints are grouped logically based on the objects they operate on. The endpoint URLs are easy to understand and predictable. For example, you can find all metadata resource endpoints, including TML and dependent objects, in the `/metadata/` resource collection.
