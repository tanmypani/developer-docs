:page-description: Read through this article to know the terminology changes.

Starting from the ThoughtSpot 8 Cloud November release, the term *Pinboard* will appear as **Liveboard** in ThoughtSpot application UI and websites. As part of rebranding, the `pinboard` terminology in ThoughtSpot application and other related interfaces has been updated. For example, the *pinboard* instances in the ThoughtSpot UI and Visual Embed SDK libraries now show as `Liveboard`. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
We are in the process of rolling out terminology changes across all ThoughtSpot interfaces, platforms, websites, and information artifacts. During this period, your environment may show some instances of `pinboard` based on the rebranding rollout stage. For detailed information about the impacted interfaces and the terminology changes, see the following sections.

== Application components and interfaces with legacy terminology

To ensure that existing customizations and integrations work seamlessly, the following application components and interfaces will continue to use the legacy terminology:

* REST API endpoint URLs
* Metadata object headers and dependent object references
+
For example, `PINBOARD_ANSWER_BOOK` is a valid metadata object `type` that represents a Liveboard object. 
* Query, path, and formData parameters in REST APIs
* Attribute values, object properties, and API responses
* Pinboard URLs in the application UI and system-generated links
* Object references in TML files
