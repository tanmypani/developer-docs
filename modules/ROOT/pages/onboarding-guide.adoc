:page-description: Get started with embedding thoughtSpot component in your app.

ThoughtSpot provides a SDK library to help you embed charts, tables, search functionality, a Liveboard, or the full ThoughtSpot experience in your app.

Let's get started with embedding a Liveboard in your application. A Liveboard in ThoughtSpot refers to a collection of charts and tables saved by a user for live analytics.

✓ Add your application domain to the CSP and CORS allowlist.
In your ThoughtSpot application, go to **Develop** > **Customizations** > **Security Settings** page and xref:security-settings.adoc[add your application domain URLs as a CSP Visual Embed and CORS host].

== Basic embed

Embedding a ThoughtSpot component in your app is easy and requires only a few steps. Let's embed a simple Liveboard with charts and tables. The following figure shows the contents and layout of a ThoughtSpot Liveboard.

=== Step 1: Install the Visual Embed SDK

Install the Visual Embed SDK. The latest version of the Visual Embed SDK is available at link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk, window=_blank].

[source,console]
----
npm install @thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk
----

=== Step 2: Import the SDK into your project

You must import the SDK package to your application environment. Let's import the `LiveboardEmbed` SDK package to embed a Liveboard.

[source,JavaScript]
----
// ESM via NPM
import * as TsEmbedSDK from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
// OR
import { LiveboardEmbed } from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';

// NPM <script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/tsembed.js"></script>;
// Make the SDK available on global namespace window.tsembed

// ES6 from web
import {
    LiveboardEmbed,
    AuthType,
    init,
} from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/tsembed.es.js';
----

////
To embed Natural Language Search page, import the `SageEmbed` component::
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
// ESM via NPM
import * as TsEmbedSDK from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
// OR
import { LiveboardEmbed } from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';

// NPM <script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/tsembed.js"></script>;
// Make the SDK available on global namespace window.tsembed

// ES6 from web
import {
    SageEmbed,
    AuthType,
    init,
} from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/tsembed.es.js';
----
////

[#initSdk]
=== Step 3: Initialize the SDK
Add the hostname or IP address of your ThoughtSpot host and set the authentication type.

The `authType` is one of the options you choose when preparing your environment. For testing purposes, you can set the `authType` as `AuthType.None`.

[source,JavaScript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.None,
});
----

For other authentication options, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc[Authentication].

=== Step 4: Embed the ThoughtSpot component

Use this code sample to embed a Liveboard.

Don't know the GUID of the Liveboard? Open the Liveboard in the UI and copy the GUID from the URL.
You can also use the Visual Embed Playground to view the Liveboard GUID.

If you are a free trial user, use the GUID of your Liveboard; for example, `22e79c21-eec4-40bf-997b-7454c6e3a2a5`.

JavaScript::
[source,JavaScript]
----
import {
    LiveboardEmbed,
} from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';

const lb = new LiveboardEmbed('#container', {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    // If using free trial instance, use 22e79c21-eec4-40bf-997b-7454c6e3a2a5
    liveboardId: '22e79c21-eec4-40bf-997b-7454c6e3a2a5',
});

// Do not forget to call render.
lb.render();
----

////
----
// [Optional]: Register event listeners.
lb.on(EmbedEvent.LiveboardRendered, (e) => {
    /* handler */
});

// [Optional]: Trigger events on the Liveboard
lb.trigger(HostEvent.UpdateRuntimeFilters, [
    {
        columnName: 'item type',
        operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
        values: ['Jackets'],
    },
]);
----
////

////
React::
[source,TypeScript]
----
import { LiveboardEmbed } from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/react';

const App = () => {
    const embedRef = useEmbedRef();
    const onLiveboardRendered = () => {
        embedRef.current.trigger(HostEvent.UpdateRuntimeFilters, [
            {
                columnName: 'item type',
                operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
                values: ['Jackets'],
            },
        ]);
    };
    return (
        <LiveboardEmbed
            ref={embedRef}
            liveboardId="22e79c21-eec4-40bf-997b-7454c6e3a2a5"
            onLiveboardRendered={onLiveboardRendered}
        />
    );
};
----

For more information about events, see xref:HostEvent.adoc[HostEvent] and xref:EmbedEvent.adoc[EmbedEvent].
////

=== Step 5: Verify the embedded Liveboard

Load the embedded object in your app. If the embedding is successful, you will see a Liveboard page with visualizations.
