:page-description: Embed Liveboards without using Visual Embed SDK

The Visual Embed SDK is the most convenient way to embed different types of ThoughtSpot content. However, if your  portal or system does not have a way to use the Visual Embed SDK JavaScript library, you can embed ThoughtSpot components using an iFrame element. For example, to embed a Liveboard or visualization in portals such as Salesforce, SharePoint, Google Sites, or WordPress, you may want to use an iFrame element.

== Authentication and security settings for an embedded instance

All embedded ThoughtSpot objects require authentication. If the host application does not allow custom Javascript, you can use one of the following authentication methods:

* Basic authentication with username and password
* SSO authentication

When doing a direct embed, xref:configure-saml.adoc[SAML] is typically the only SSO mechanism that can be implemented.
If you cannot use the Visual Embed SDK, this typically means the environment you are embedding ThoughtSpot within has restrictions on using JavaScript, which limits the ability to use the xref:trusted-authentication.adoc[Trusted Authentication] method for SSO. Any sign-in method to ThoughtSpot creates a session, stored in the browser cookies, so if your platform has a way to complete the trusted authentication flow at some point, even on a different page from where the direct iFrame embed of a Liveboard is, it may be a viable SSO authentication mechanism.

=== SAML SSO authentication

To enable SAML SSO authentication for an iFrame embedded instance:

. On your ThoughtSpot instance, configure xref:configure-saml.adoc#admin-portal[SAML SSO].
. xref:configure-saml.adoc#idp-config[Configure your IdP] to allow the host domain to embed the IdP's authentication page.
+
Each IdP has a specific way to enable this setting. For example, for Okta, you can use the  link:https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Settings/settings-customization-general.htm[Enable iframe embedding, window=_blank] option in Okta's Admin console.

== Add host domain to the CSP allowlist

If you have access to the *Security settings* page in the *Develop* tab, you can xref:security-settings.adoc#csp-viz-embed-hosts[add your host domain to CSP] and xref:security-settings.adoc#cors-hosts[CORS]  allowlists. For example, if you are embedding a ThoughtSpot object in a Google site, you can add `sites.google.com` to the allowlists.

If you don't have access to *Develop* > *Security settings* page, contact ThoughtSpot support to update CSP settings on your instance.

== Embed a Liveboard or single visualization

To embed ThoughtSpot objects in an iFrame, follow the steps described in this article.

=== Get the Liveboard and visualization GUIDs

New Experience::
To get the Liveboard URL:

. Log in to ThoughtSpot.
. Navigate to the Liveboard that you want to embed.
. Click the share icon.
. Click *Copy link*.
. Note the GUID of the Liveboard.

+
To get the visualization URL:

. Navigate to the Liveboard that contains the visualization you want to embed.
. On the visualization tile, click the *More* image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] and select *Copy link*.
. Note the GUIDs of the Liveboard and visualization.

Classic Experience::
To get Liveboard URL:

. Log in to ThoughtSpot.
. Navigate to the Liveboard that you want to embed.
. Click the *More* image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], and select *Copy embed link*.
. Note the GUID of the Liveboard.

+
To get the visualization URL: +

. Navigate to the Liveboard that you want to embed.
. Navigate  to the table or chart.
. Click *More* image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] and select *Copy link*.
. Note the GUIDs of the Liveboard and visualization.

=== Construct the URL

Note the URL format to embed a Liveboard in an iFrame:

`https://{Thoughtspot-Host}/?embedApp=true#/embed/viz/{Liveboard_id}`

The URL format to embed a visualization in an iFrame is:

`https://{Thoughtspot-Host}/?embedApp=true#/embed/viz/{Liveboard_id}/{visualization_id}`

If you have access to the *Develop* tab in the ThoughtSpot UI, you can use the Playground to obtain the URL for iFrame embed.

. Go to *Develop* > *Playground* > *Visual embed*.
. Select an object to embed.
. Configure the parameters for the embedded view. You can also use the flags to customize, enable, and disable features in the embedded view and inspect the
. Inspect the output and note the URL in the `iframe src` element.
+

The following example shows the URL format copied from the iFrame element. Note that URL includes feature flags like `isFullHeightPinboard` and the `hideAction` array  to embed a visualization in an iFrame is:

`https://{Thoughtspot-Host}/?embedApp=true&hideAction=[&quot;edit&quot;,&quot;explore&quot]&isFullHeightPinboard=true#/embed/viz/{Liveboard_id}/{visualization_id}`


==== Apply runtime filters (Optional)

To pass filters as URL query parameters, use runtime filters.

For example, to filter `michigan` in the `State` column of a visualization on a Liveboard, pass these values as filter parameters in the URL:

----
http://{ThoughtspotHost}/?embedApp=true#/embed/viz/{Liveboard_id}/{visualization_id}
&col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=michigan
----

For more information, see xref:runtime-filters.adoc[runtime filters, window=_blank].

== Embed Search



== Examples
=== Simple embedding in Salesforce
If you have configured ThoughtSpot to use the same SAML provider as a Salesforce instance, you can create a simple Visualforce page that can embed ThoughtSpot Liveboards or individual visualizations.

First, as a developer, select **Create a New Visualforce Page**.

The following code example can be used to define the new page. It defines the iFrame, with the ThoughtSpot URL using a runtime filter to personalize the results to the Salesforce user:

[source, xml]
----
<apex:page standardController="Account" tabStyle="Account">
<apex:pageBlock title="ThoughtSpot">
<apex:iframe src="https://{thoughtspot-server}/?embedApp=true#/embed/viz/{Liveboard_id}/{visualization_id}/?col1={field_name}&op1=EQ&val1={!account.Name}" frameborder="0" height="690" width="100%">
</apex:iframe>
</apex:pageBlock>
</apex:page>
----

Note that the `{!account.Name}` is a Salesforce APEX variable. The other curly braces represent permanent values from your ThoughtSpot instance that you would hardcode into the APEX page.

More complex integrations to Salesforce, utilizing the Visual Embed SDK, can be achieved using Lightning components. For additional integration beyond what is described in this article, contact your ThoughtSpot Support.

== Other methods of embedding without SDK

. Create a ThoughtSpot plugin for your hosting platform, for example, SharePoint, WordPress. In the plugin context, the platform can provide more flexibility for adding custom Javascript.
. Create a proxy to forward requests from the embedded iFrame to Thoughtspot after adding the necessary authentication.
. Use xref:pinboarddata.adoc[Liveboard REST API] to pull only the data values and then render them in your app.
. For mobile apps, it's easier to use the xref:pinboarddata.adoc[Liveboard REST API] to pull only the data values and then render them using a table or charting library native to the mobile platform.
