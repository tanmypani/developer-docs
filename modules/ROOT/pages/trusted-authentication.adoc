:page-description: You can configure support for token-based authentication service on ThoughtSpot.

Trusted authentication defines a method for authenticating users with *login tokens* obtained from ThoughtSpot. In the trusted authentication method, a security token is issued by the authenticating server to authenticate users who request access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content. For trusted authentication, you will require an authenticator server or service, which can securely authenticate your application users.

[#trusted-auth-enable]
== Quick start

The Trusted authentication implementation method includes the following steps:

. xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#_get_a_secret_key_for_trusted_authentication[Enable Trusted authentication on ThoughtSpot]
. Copy the `secret_key` from the **Develop** > **Customizations** > **Security Settings** page. This secret key allows the authenticator server to request a login token __for any user__ on the ThoughtSpot Server. The login token is then sent to the user's web browser, where it is used in the login process.
. In the Visual Embed SDK, define the authentication type in `init`. You can configure cookie-based (`AuthType.TrustedAuthToken`) or cookieless authentication (`AuthType.TrustedAuthTokenCookieless`) as per your deployment needs. If you are embedding ThoughtSpot content in an app that is not in the same domain as your ThoughtSpot instance, and your web browser blocks third-party cookies, use cookieless authentication.
+
When `init()` is called, the SDK checks if there is an existing ThoughtSpot session for the instance in the browser. If not, it will request a *login token* from either the `authEndpoint` URL specified in the SDK or the `getAuthToken` callback function.  For `authEndPoint`, specify the authentication endpoint URL from which you want to obtain the authentication token. If using `getAuthToken`, call the `getAuthToken` function to invoke your login endpoint. The login endpoint then returns a `Promise` string that resolves to an authentication token.

=== AuthType.TrustedAuthToken

Generates a bearer token for a given user and sets a JSESSIONID cookie to identify the signed-in user in subsequent sessions.

.Cookie-based authentication
[source,JavaScript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.TrustedAuthToken,
    username: "<username>",
    authEndpoint: "https://authenticator-server:<port>/endpoint",
});
----

In this example, a GET request is made directly to the provided URL. The authentication details must be included by the browser in this automated GET request, typically in the cookies. Cookies are not sent across domains (only to sub-domains), so your *authenticator service* must be *hosted in the same domain* as the embedding application.

[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.TrustedAuthToken,
    username: "<username>",
    getAuthToken: () => {
    return fetch('https://{YOUR-backend.app}/ts-token')
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((data) => data.token);
});
----

=== AuthType.TrustedAuthTokenCookieless
Generates a bearer token for a given user and uses it to identify the signed-in user in subsequent sessions.  This method doesn’t generate or set a JSESSIONID cookie in API calls. Instead, the bearer token stored in the app memory is used to authenticate API requests to ThoughtSpot. +
If the embedded content in your app doesn’t originate from the same domain as your embedding application, and your Web browsers restrict third-party cookies and block embedded content, you can implement cookieless authentication.

**Cookieless authentication**
[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.TrustedAuthTokenCookieless,
    authEndpoint: "https://authenticator-server:<port>/endpoint",
});
----

**Cookieless authentication**
[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.TrustedAuthTokenCookieless,
    getAuthToken: () => {
 	return fetch('https://{YOUR-backend.app}/ts-token')
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((data) => data.token);
    },
});
----

[NOTE]
====
The generated authentication token is valid for only five minutes. Make sure the `getAuthToken` function returns a fresh token for each re-login. Using older tokens to renew a user session will lead to authentication failure.
====

==== Autologin and redirects

When a user session expires, the embedded app redirects its users to the login page. To refresh a user session and automatically log in a user to the embedded app, you can set the `disableLoginRedirect` and `autoLogin` attributes to `true`.

----
disableLoginRedirect: true,
autoLogin: true,
----

[NOTE]
====
If you are using Cookieless authentication (`AuthType.TrustedAuthTokenCookieless`), you do not need to set the `autoLogin` parameter to `true`. Because when the bearer token expires, a new token will be generated and fetched from the authentication server to sign in the user to the embedded ThoughtSpot instance.
====

The trusted authentication workflow logs in via AJAX requests that are not visible to the end-user, even if they fail. Use the event emitter returned by the `init` call to listen to the login failure events. You can also register an event handler to trigger the `AuthInit event` to detect and respond to errors in the login process.

== Detailed description

=== Authentication workflow

Trusted authentication establishes a ThoughtSpot session in the browser without requiring a user to sign in directly to ThoughtSpot or be redirected to a third-party IdP. It is the most seamless method of single sign-on (SSO) but requires more of the application developer to secure the process.

The *authentication token* from the ThoughtSpot is a simple, proprietary token. Securely requesting the login token requires passing authentication details from the embedding application securely to an *authenticator service* with access to the `secret_key` for the ThoughtSpot instance and ThoughtSpot admin user's credentials.

The Trusted authentication mode supports cookie-based and cookieless authentication. In cookie-based authentication, the login token is only necessary during the login process, after which any request to ThoughtSpot will include session cookies that identify the signed-in user.
In cookieless authentication, the bearer token issued by the authentication server is used to authenticate API requests to ThoughtSpot.

The Trusted authentication includes the following:

1. The Visual Embed SDK, loaded within the embedded application page, calls the `init()` function with the correct set of parameters to request a *login token*.
2. The request for the *login token* securely provides the username and any additional details to the *authenticator service*.
3. The *authenticator service* verifies and parses the username and other details, and issues REST API commands to ThoughtSpot, such as requesting a *login token* for the provided username.
4. The *authenticator service* returns the *login token* to the browser and the Visual Embed SDK.
5. The Visual Embed SDK issues requests to establish a ThoughtSpot session in the browser.

The following figure illustrates the trusted authentication workflow with session cookies and REST API calls to v1 endpoints:

[NOTE]
====
Trusted authentication requires xref:security-settings.adoc#cors-hosts[setting up CORS] so that your application can call ThoughtSpot to authenticate your user.
====

=== Secret key generation

To obtain an authentication token for authenticating and logging in a ThoughtSpot user, the `secret_key` is required. To generate a secret key, the ThoughtSpot administrator must enable *Trusted authentication*. +

[NOTE]
====
Org administrators can generate a unique secret key for respective Orgs. To enable this feature on your cluster, contact ThoughtSpot Support.
====

To generate a secret key:

. Log in to the ThoughtSpot.
. If Orgs are configured on your instance, switch to the Org for which you want to generate a secret key.
+
If the per-Org secret key feature is not enabled on your instance and if you want to generate a separate secret key for each Org, contact ThoughtSpot Support. ThoughtSpot also allows you to generate a secret key at the primary Org (Org 0) level and use it to obtain an authentication token for a user.
. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Security settings*.
. Click *Edit*.
. To enable trusted authentication, turn on the *Trusted authentication* toggle.
. To copy the secret key, click *Edit* again, navigate to *Trusted authentication*, and then click the clipboard icon.
+
The following example shows a ThoughtSpot-generated secret key string.

== Authenticator service / back-end

The authenticator service should exist at the web application tier of your networks, with secure access to the ThoughtSpot `secret_key` and the credentials of a ThoughtSpot administrator user (typically a service account).

There are no requirements for how the authenticator service is built or hosted, other than being able to issue REST API commands to the ThoughtSpot instance and having access to the `secret_key`. ThoughtSpot generates a `secret_key` when trusted authentication is enabled on a ThoughtSpot application instance. When using a ThoughtSpot cloud instance, the authenticator service will need outbound request access to the hosted ThoughtSpot cloud instance.

The simplest *authenticator service* does the following steps, assuming ThoughtSpot users already exist from another process:

1. Verify and parse the authentication message to retrieve the ThoughtSpot username.
2. Request a login token from ThoughtSpot using REST API v1.
3. Return the token to the user's web browser.

If user creation and group assignment must be performed at the time of the login token request, the *authenticator service* must follow the steps described in the xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#_just_in_time_user_provisioning_and_group_assignment[Just-in-time user provisioning and group assignment] section of this article.

=== Verify and parse the authentication message
As mentioned in the preceding section, the exact way you send the authentication details varies with your implementation. The *authenticator service* must verify the request and then parse out the details (at minimum, the *ThoughtSpot username* value) so that they can be used in the subsequent REST API requests to ThoughtSpot.

The *authenticator service* will need access to whatever code and other services are necessary to parse out the authentication details. For example, if you are sending through an OAuth token from an IdP, the IdP may provide a library or set of instructions using standard libraries. If using the application's existing session system, there will be some way to retrieve the username based on the session details from the request. You can also define your own JWT or some other secure way for your web application to send the message securely.

If your *authenticator service* must also create users and give them access, you must parse out additional details from the request:

* user email address +
* user display name +
* ThoughtSpot group names to add a user to +
* Org ID to which the user belongs +

User password is not required in the login token request. It can be randomly generated if creating a user account in ThoughtSpot so that the user can only sign in via the embedding application.

=== REST API session sign-in
The *authenticator service* makes REST API requests to ThoughtSpot. To make a REST API request for a login token, the *authenticator service* must have xref:api-auth-session.adoc[created an active session] as a ThoughtSpot user with *server administrator* privileges, typically a service account created only for use by the *authenticator service*.

The authenticator service code will need logic to log in if there is no active session and secure access to the service account credentials. How you protect and securely access the service account credentials is up to you in the design of the service. Any examples with a username and password entered directly in the code are for *testing purposes only*.

=== Login token request via REST API
The only other REST API call *necessary* after sign-in is the xref:session-api.adoc#session-authToken[request for the login token]. This is the call that utilizes the `secret_key`, which the *authenticator service* must also securely store and access along with the service account user credentials.

When a token has been requested in `FULL` mode, it will create a full ThoughtSpot session in the browser and application. The token for `FULL` access mode persists through several sessions and stays valid until another token is generated.

You can request a limited token using the `access_level=REPORT_BOOK_VIEW` option in REST API v1 and `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object` endpoint in REST API v2.0, but this is rarely used and not recommended.
Access control in ThoughtSpot (called Sharing) prohibits a signed-in user from loading any content to which they don't have access. Access control (sharing) can be granted during the login token request process by adding the user to the appropriate ThoughtSpot groups.

=== Just-in-time user provisioning and group assignment

The REST API endpoints support just-in-time provisioning of users. If the user specified in the API request does not exist in the ThoughtSpot system, you can set the `autocreate` property to `true` to add the user to ThoughtSpot and assign the user to `groups`.

The typical flow of REST API requests for user creation at the time of a login token request is as follows: +

1. Make a REST API request to xref:user-api.adoc#get-user-details[get the user details].
2. If the user already exists, check the `assignedGroups` property. On clusters with Orgs feature enabled, check the `orgIds` property to verify if the user mapped to any Org.
3. If the user doesn't exist in ThoughtSpot, you can either xref:user-api.adoc#create-user[create a new user] or set the `autocreate` property to `true` in your API request to the `/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token` endpoint. You can also specify the Org ID and group name to add the user to the Org and groups in the same API request.
4. If the user should be logged in to a different Org context, specify the Org ID in the `orgid` property and set `autocreate` to `true`. +
+
[NOTE]
====
Org IDs are integers that are created automatically when a cluster administrator creates an Org. To know the Org IDs of Orgs, you can send a `GET` request to the `/tspublic/v1/session/orgs` API endpoint. If you have cluster administrator privileges, you can use the `/tspublic/v1/org/search` endpoint to get a list of all Orgs available on your cluster.
====

5. If the user should belong to other groups, add group names in the `groups` property when making an API call to the `/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token` endpoint. If these groups don't exist in the specified `orgid`, set `autocreate` to `true` to add these groups to the Org.
6. Request a login token from ThoughtSpot via `/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token` API endpoint.
7. Return the token to the user's web browser.

[NOTE]
====
The `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object` and `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` endpoints in REST API v2.0 also support JIT  provisioning and assigning the user to groups and Orgs.
====

=== Additional REST API requests
Because all of ThoughtSpot administration is possible via the REST API, you can incorporate even more functionality into the *authenticator service* if necessary, building it into an authentication and authorization service. The xref:api-user-management.adoc[user and group privileges] REST API documentation covers the additional requests related to authorization.

For example, you could use the xref:rest-api-reference.adoc#_groups_and_privileges[REST API v1] or xref:rest-api-v2-reference.adoc#_groups[REST API v2.0] group endpoints to implement ThoughtSpot groups that are intended for use in Row Level Security (RLS) rules. For these groups, the group name must match exactly with a value in a column in the data warehouse, so the name of the group itself serves as a __data entitlement__. You could adjust the flow described in the preceding section to create any group for RLS that did not already exist and assign it to the user, which would

=== Secure the authentication details request
For the request to the *authenticator service* to be secure, the user in the browser cannot modify the request or make their own valid request to the *authenticator service*.

How your particular application can most easily securely request the *login token* is up to you, but how you choose to send the message will constrain your choice between `authEndpoint` or `getAuthToken`.

* If you choose `AuthType.TrustedAuthTokenCookieless`, a bearer token is issued for the given username. This token is stored in the app's memory and used for maintaining subsequent user sessions. You can use this authentication type if your *authenticator service* is not *hosted in the same domain* as the embedding application, and your browser restricts using third-party cookies.

* When using `getAuthToken`, you specify a function that returns a Promise that resolves with the *login token*. Within the callback function, you can define the request to the *authenticator service* with far greater control than the automated `GET` request to a URL used by the `authEndpoint` option. `getAuthToken` is the preferred method for production deployments unless your *authenticator service* is implemented within the existing API endpoints of your application and a simple GET request provides the necessary authentication details as shown here.

+
The following example shows a callback function with a custom request using link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch[Fetch, window=_blank], which returns a Promise. You can also use link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest[XHR, window=_blank] and build the link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise[Promise, window=_blank] manually.

init({
    thoughtSpotHost: tsURL,

  });

function async getAuthToken {
  const tokenURL = tokenServiceURL + "/gettoken/";
  console.log("calling token server at " + tokenURL);

  const timeoutSecs = 5 * 1000; // seconds to milliseconds

    tokenURL,

    }
  ))

  //console.log(await response.text());
  return response.text()
}

[#login-token]
== Login token expiration

The login token, also referred to as the authentication token, allows users to access the requested object. It is a proprietary token format that cannot be decoded or used for any purpose other than to create a ThoughtSpot session.

Tokens stay valid for a length of time based on the following rules:

* A token stays valid indefinitely until another token for any user is generated.
* When a new token is generated using the same `secret_key`, the previous token will expire after five minutes.
* When a new `secret_key` is generated for the ThoughtSpot server and the first new login token is obtained using the new `secret_key`, all tokens generated using the previous `secret_key` become invalid.
* If users make multiple attempts to log in to ThoughtSpot using an invalid or expired token, they may get locked out of their accounts.

To set a consistent five-minute expiration time, you can generate a second token to start the expiration clock for the previous login token that is sent to the user's browser.

[NOTE]
====
On multi-tenant clusters with Orgs, users must use the Org-specific tokens when switching between Orgs.
====

== How to turn off trusted authentication

To disable trusted authentication, follow these steps:

. Log in to ThoughtSpot.
. If the per-Org secret key feature is enabled and Orgs are configured on your instance, switch to the Org for which you want to disable trusted authentication.
. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Security settings*.
. Click *Edit* and turn off the *Trusted authentication* toggle.
+
A pop-up window appears and prompts you to confirm the disable action.

. Click *Disable*.

+
When you disable trusted authentication, the validity of your existing secret key expires, and your app may become inoperable.


== Trusted authentication code samples

The following GitHub repositories include code samples for trusted authentication implementation:

* Sample code for the app backend to include an authentication server for ThoughtSpot:
** link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/node-token-auth-server-example[TypeScript, window=_blank]
** link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/ts_everywhere_resources/tree/master/examples/token_auth[Python (Flask Service), window=_blank]
* Sample code of an application frontend authenticating via trusted authentication.
** link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/big-react-demo[React code samples, window=_blank]

To a new secret key and generate authentication tokens, you must enable Trusted authentication.


== Troubleshoot trusted authentication

[NOTE]
====
When implementing trusted authentication with session cookies, check if your browser allows third-party cookies. Chrome now blocks third-party cookies in Incognito mode by default, while Safari blocks them by default even in standard mode. If your Web browser rejects third-party cookies, the embedded content will be blocked. To workaround this issue, you can enable cookieless authentication (`AuthType.TrustedAuthTokenCookieless`) in the SDK.
====

* The REST API v2.0 allows using bearer or trusted authentication tokens. The authentication tokens obtained from REST API separate from the REST API v1 login token.
////
====

////
REST API clients can make a `GET` or `POST` API call to the xref:session-api.adoc#session-loginToken[tspublic/v1/session/login/token] API endpoint to log in a user. Note that the `GET` call to the `tspublic/v1/session/login/token` endpoint must include a fully-encoded URL with the authentication token and resource endpoint in the request URL.
