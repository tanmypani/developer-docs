:page-description: Customize UX elements and layout of embedded ThoughtSpot interface using custom CSS

ThoughtSpot provides advanced style customization capabilities with the custom CSS framework. The custom CSS feature allows you to override the default styles, color schemes, design elements, and typography of ThoughtSpot elements to match the look and feel of your host application.

== Before you begin

* Identify the UI elements you want to customize.
* For best results, you can combine the customization settings in the UI and custom CSS. However,
note that CSS overrides take precedence over the style customization settings configured in the UI. For more information,  see xref:style-customization.adoc#_scope_of_customization[Scope of customization].
* Try it out in the Visual Embed Playground.
The *Visual Embed* Playground now includes the *Apply Styles* checkbox, using which you can try out the variables and rules. +
To preview the CSS settings:
. Go to *Develop* > *Visual Embed* > *Playground*.
+
If you are using the new experience, click *Developer* in the app selector image:./images/app_switcher.png[the app switcher menu] and navigate to the Visual Embed Playground..

. Select the embed element. For example, *Full App*.
. Select *Apply custom styles*.
+
The following code text appears in the `init` function and is highlighted in the code panel:

[source,JavaScript]

customizations: {
    style: {
      customCSSUrl: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/css-variables.css", // location of your stylesheet
      // To apply overrides for your stylesheet in this init, provide variable values
      customCSS: {
        variables: {
          "--ts-var-button--secondary-background": "#F0EBFF",
          "--ts-var-button--secondary--hover-background": "#E3D9FC",
          "--ts-var-root-background": "#F7F5FF",
        },
      },
    },
  },
----
