:page-description:  Use the Robe-based access control feature for granular access control

With Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) [beta betaBackground]^Beta^, ThoughtSpot administrators can assign and manage granular privileges to users. A `Role` is a collection of privileges that determine users' access to ThoughtSpot objects and workflows.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The RBAC feature is in beta and is turned off by default. To enable this feature on your cluster, contact ThoughtSpot Support. Note that once you enable RBAC, it cannot be disabled.
====

== How it works

If the RBAC feature is enabled on your instance, administrators can grant granular privileges and implement fine-grained access control. For example, on ThoughtSpot instances with no RBAC, members of the groups with administrative privileges can view, edit, and manage all metadata objects of ThoughtSpot. Roles allow you to break administration privileges into specific categories such as user administration, group administration, application administration, and so on, and restrict application-wide access only to super admin users.

Administrators can create a Role with a specific set of privileges and assign this Role to a group via UI or API calls. Users inherit the Role privileges from the groups to which they are assigned. To assign a Role to a user, administrators must assign the Role to a group and ensure that the intended user is added to this group.

The following figure illustrates Role and Group assignment in ThoughtSpot:

[NOTE]
====
Groups are unique to an Org and can be created only within the context of an Org.

== Role privileges

The RBAC feature groups access privileges under specific categories for granular access control and ease of use:s

=== Admin control
Includes Role privileges that allow administrative access to create and manage ThoughtSpot objects such as users, groups, and Roles.

== How to create and assign Roles

You can create and assign Roles to a group on link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/rbac[Admin page of the UI, window=_blank] or by using the REST API v1 and v2 endpoints.

== Migrating to RBAC
The Role privileges function in the same way as group privileges. When RBAC is enabled, the corresponding group privileges are automatically migrated to Role privileges. For example, a group with `DATAMANAGEMENT` privilege will be assigned `DATAMANAGEMENT` (**Can manage data**) Role privilege. For granular access, you can create a Role and assign it to groups.
