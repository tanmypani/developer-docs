:page-description: ThoughtSpot REST API provides service endpoints for administration, embedding, and data management.

The ThoughtSpot REST API framework lets you create, access, edit, and manage objects and resources in the ThoughtSpot system programmatically.

ThoughtSpot REST API supports several resource collections and operations in two distinct versions:

* REST API v1
+
The legacy framework with several endpoints to create, edit, administer and manage ThoughtSpot objects and data.

* REST API v2.0
+
The REST API v2.0 framework provides enhanced functionality and improved API experience with an interactive Playground.

For more information about the differences between these two REST API versions, see xref:rest-api-v1v2-comparison.adoc[REST API v1 and v2.0 comparison].

== REST API Playground

ThoughtSpot users with Developer or Administrator privileges can access the REST API v1 and v2.0 endpoints in the *Develop* tab. The portal provides a separate Playground for each REST API version and lets you explore the API endpoints, request and response workflows.
